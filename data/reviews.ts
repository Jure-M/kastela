      "Just great stylish room! Pleasure to stay there. Everything was new and very clean. We also had couple breakfasts there, so you assume we found everything one might need while cooking, keeping and eating. Very much recommend it, if one plans to visit several locations around, not just Split. I also assume future travelers are going to have a car, cause that is what I did, probably other reviews might help with public transportation, didn't have a chance to check that. Overall neat, clean and comfortable room for two.",
